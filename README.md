Here are a list of projects I have worked on relating to machine learning and computer vision. 

# Recommendation Algorithm Script.py:
This is a recommendation algorithm I created using graphlab and written in Python. I create two recommendation engines- one based on popularity and another based item similarity (Item-Based Collaberative Filtering).

# SosaThesis.pdf:
This is my thesis from the University of California - Los Angeles. 

# Stats 231 - Project 1.docx:
A document containing results of a machine learning project I worked on at UCLA.

# Stats 231 - Project 3.docx:
Another document containing results of a machine learning project I worked on at UCLA.

# Support_Vector_Machine_Political_Candidates.m: 
This code is from a project I worked on where facial festures of a presidential candidate are used to determine the outcomes of an election. Code is written in MATLAB.

# kmeans-Clustering.py: 
A clustering algorithhm using the sklean toolkit in Python.

# mastersthesis_code_PCA_Face_Images_Non_Linear.m:
The MATLAB code for my master's thesis in Facial Recognition

# Machine Learning Model Assessment.R:
This script is a model assessment for events data using a series of ridge/lasso/ multivariate spline regression. This code is wrriten in R.
